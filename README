This package goal is to help the packages' author (Arthur Milchior, arthur@milchior.fr) to learn solfege on multiple instruments. In order to do this, it generates notes for the spaced repetition program anki <https://apps.ankiweb.net/>, and images to be used in those notes. The detail of each kind of notes and images is described in the README of each subdirectory.

Running python3 instrument should generate the notes and images only for this instrument. In order to generate a single kind of note, see the README inside the subdirectories.



P.S.:
This code was main mainly for my particular use. While I tried to comment it, and make it reusable, there is no garantee of any kind. In particular, there may be fault, there may be things which are not academically correct, both in the code, and in the images generated.
