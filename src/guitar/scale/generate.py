Here is the list of each scales I found in English wikipedia. With the exception of the scales which can not be easily be played on guitar, e.g. scales using interval smaller than half-tones.

For each of them, there is the list of way to play this scale, on one octave, on a standard guitar fret. The only exception being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_scale">Algerian scale</a> which, by definition, is played on two octaves.

Here are the technical restrictions I used, to choose which scale's position to generates.
<ul><li>
It is assumed that, there is never more than {increase_fret_limit} fret from the first to the last note played on a single string.
</li><li> Furthermore, there is never more than {decreasing_fret_limit} fret in distance from the the highest note played on a string, and the lowest note played on the following string. </li></lu>
<ul>
