This module contains everything related to guitar.

The solo module generates images for notes, with a single note played. Between fret 0 (empty) and 6. I use those images to illustrate the starting/ending point of a scale/chord

Similarly, the pair module generates pair on note on distinct string. Those are used to learn the distance between two notes. Anki notes are also generated in order to learn those distances.

Scales create each scales of the scale list, starting on each position (each string, each fret between 1 and 4). Scales with open chords are not (yet, todo) considered. Some restrictions are applied, to allows scales to be actually playable. 

TODO: also create anki card for this

chords:
Consider each way to place fingers on at least four of the six strings.
If its a chord, satisfying some condition, the image is generated, and an anki note is also generated. 


file:
__init__.py : generates everything mentionned above
pos.py: two classes:
--Pos, representing a position on the guitar
--SetofPos: a set of pos, with some functions to test it as a chord
